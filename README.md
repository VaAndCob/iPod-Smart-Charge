## ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

A revolutionary charging controller designed to dramatically extend your iPod's battery lifespan by implementing intelligent charging strategies.

Features
ðŸš€ Smart Battery Saver Mode: Instead of charging to a damaging 100%, this system cycles the battery between 30% and 85%. This simple change can double your battery's lifespan.

ðŸ”¬ Precision-Controlled Charging: The charger actively monitors the real power flow, pausing intermittently to verify the true battery level. This "Charge-Stop-Check" method prevents overcharging and ensures your battery gets exactly what it needs.

ðŸ§  Adaptive Technology: It intelligently detects signs of battery degradation and automatically adjusts the charging parameters to protect older, more fragile batteries.
